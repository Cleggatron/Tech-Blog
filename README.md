  ## Installation

  Once the repo has been cloned locally from github, you cna run this locally by installing the dependencies using `npm i` and then setting up the database using `mysql -u root -p` followed by `source ./db/schema.sql`. Finally typing `npm start`. This will enable the site to on on your localhost. If you wish to make this live on the web you will need to push up to a service such as Heroku, following their installation practises.

  ## Usage

  ![File In Action]()

  Once it is live you can login, using the login screen. Then navigating to the dashboard will allow you to create a new post, and clicking onto the displayed posts will allow editing/deletion. ]
